# LAKAS FITNESS 

This application is a frontend-only signup fitness site sample intended for studying bootstrap 5. It has 2 popup modals: one for signup and one for login. There is also a forgot username/password link on the login modal that links to a new page that prompts a user to enter in their email for it to be sent. Due to Bootstrap 5 having validation capability- it is applied frontend as well. 

Below is a current working stable version of the main branch:

I used HTML, CSS, and bootstrap 5 to create it because I wanted to study and experiment with how fast and effective it was to create a responsive website using a framework than not.
