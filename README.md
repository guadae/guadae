I used HTML, CSS, and bootstrap 5 to create it because I wanted to study and experiment with how fast and effective it was to create a responsive website using a framework than not.

In the future I hope to implement form validation using jquery, a maps page that shows sample locations of locations, and a full login page showing a user's subscription history and personal information.
