# LAKAS FITNESS 

This application is a frontend signup fitness site sample intended for studying bootstrap 5. 

I used HTML, CSS, and bootstrap 5 to create it because I wanted to study and experiment with how fast and effective it was to create a responsive website using a framework than not. 

Some of the challenges I faced was actually trying to understand how columns and rows worked and how I could implement attributes in the HTML markup for responsiveness instead of manually writing them out in the css file. In the future I hope to implement form validation using jquery, a maps page that shows sample locations of locations, and a full login page showing a user's subscription history and personal information.
